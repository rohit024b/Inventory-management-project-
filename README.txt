# python_tkinter

In this mini project that is inventory management we can add as many products as you want. 
You can add name of product, company name of the product, manufacturing year of the product and the code of the product.
In this application you can view all the entries that is all the existing data of the product by clicking the VIEW ALL button.
Also, you can search any one entry by just providing its any-one attribute from name of product, 
company name of the product, manufacturing year of the product and the code of the product.
You can update the existing data by selecting that particular data from the list of 100s of data.


Essentially a Inventory management desktop application. Used following python modules for the dev
1) tkinter  : https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter
2) sqllite3 : https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html

The idea is to get handson python GUI building and binding it with a database
